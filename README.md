Implementation and Personal Comments: 

- **Browser**: Used Opera version 74 to be able to develop and test the application

- **Heroku**: This was the first time implementing on a cloud platform. It was a challenge that took some time, however, I was able to overcome this difficult situation by effectively and efficiently learning about the tool

- **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**: Used traditional methods, without using any sort of library.

- **Responsive Web Design**: Implemented to some degree, for sure not perfect. Not sufficient time to be able to consider all type of displays. 

This is the final result:
